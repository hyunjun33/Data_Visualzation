    "## 2021: Week 19 Prep Air Project Details\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing on our fundamental skills theme in May, this week's challenge is all about string calculations. If you want to know more about what String data is and how you might want to work with it, you might want to check out our how to... deal with strings post. Pay particular attention to split, right, mid and find if you're getting stuck with this challenge! I've written another guide to the common functions that you might find use when working with Strings in Tableau. \n",

    "### The Challenge\n",
    "This week we are trying to find out more detail on what is going on with the project over runs in Prep Air (every data prepper's favourite airline). To get more detail than just what was shared last week we've uncovered the commentary log that sits behind our project management system. Like any system that holds the detail shown on the programme's interface in a log file, it has great detail but held in an unfriendly way. \n",

    "We need your help to get stuck into the messy data and extract out the useful details.\n",
