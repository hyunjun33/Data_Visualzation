    "\n",
    "Inspiration for Preppin' challenges can come from anywhere. I've recently moved into a block of flats and let me tell you, I spend a lot of time waiting for a lift (or elevator if you're across the pond). It got me pondering whether the lift is operating optimally. Is it better to stay on the floor that you drop passengers until the next time someone calls a lift, or should the lift return to the most common starting floor?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input\n",
    "There is one input this week, detailing the time of each trip the lift takes, including which floor the passengers enter the lift and which floor the passengers leave the lift. \n",
