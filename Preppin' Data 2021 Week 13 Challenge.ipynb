    "Before Simon joined The Data School in the UK, he was a professional sporting performance analyst. Simon has reached into his previous professional life to come up with a football (read soccer) based challenge for this week. \n",
    "\n",
    "Simon is channelling his inner fanalyst to use data to understand more about the game that he enjoys. \n",
    "\n",
    "This week we want to create a data set that allows us to analyse 'Open Play Goals' scored. We will rank the players overall and by their position. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Input\n",
    "\n",
    "5 csv files, all with a similar structure. There are a lot of columns in these data sets.\n",

    "4. In this challenge we are interested in the goals scored from open play\n",
    "    - Create a new “Open Play Goals” field (the goals scored from open play is the number of goals scored that weren’t penalties or freekicks)\n",
    "    - Note some players will have scored free kicks or penalties with their left or right foot\n",
    "    - Be careful how Prep handles null fields! (have a look at those penalty and free kick fields) \n",
    "    - Rename the original Goals scored field to Total Goals Scored\n",
    "5. Calculate the totals for each of the key metrics across the whole time period for each player, (be careful not to lose their position)\n",
    "6. Create an open play goals per appearance field across the whole time period\n",
    "7. Rank the players for the amount of open play goals scored across the whole time period, we are only interested in the top 20 (including those that are tied for position) – Output 1\n",
    "8. Rank the players for the amount of open play goals scored across the whole time period by position, we are only interested in the top 20 (including those that are tied for position) – Output 2\n",
